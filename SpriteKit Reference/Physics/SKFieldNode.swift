	magneticField()									// Spins bodies around their own origin point based on their charge and velocity properties (Lorentz equation pt 2)
													// If the field strength is positive bodies will spin counterclockwise, and viceversa. falloff is set to 2
	electricField()									// Repels bodies from the node based on their charge property (Lorentz equation pt 1). falloff is set to 2
	springField()									// Attracts bodies towards the node in a spring-like manner. falloff is set to -1 (the further away, the stronger the pull)
	vortexField()									// Applies constant perpendicular acceleration to all bodies (strength as meters per second)
	radialGravityField()							// Applies constant acceleration to all bodies towards the node (strength as meters per second). falloff is set to 2
	linearGravityField(withVector:)					// Applies constant acceleration to all bodies towards a given direction (vector as meters per second)
	velocityField(withVector:)						// Applies constant velocity to all bodies towards a given direction (vector as meters per second)
	velocityField(with:)							// Applies constant velocity to all bodies based on a given normal texture
	noiseField(withSmoothness:animationSpeed:)		// Applies constant acceleration to all bodies in random directions
	turbulenceField(withSmoothness:animationSpeed:)	// Applies acceleration in random directions based on each body's velocity
	customField(evaluationBlock:)					// Executes a callback block on every frame, block gets position, velocity, mass, charge and deltaTime, returns a vector_float3

		region = SKRegion.infinite()	// get/set the area (defined as a SKRegion object) that the field affects. Defaults to infinite
