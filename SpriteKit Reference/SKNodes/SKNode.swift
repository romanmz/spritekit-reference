	// ------------------------------
	// Render order and Hit testing
	// ------------------------------
	/*
	The order of the nodes in the 'children' array affects rendering and hit testing
	
	ORDER:
	- parent nodes are rendered before their children
	- child nodes are rendered in the order in which they appear in the array
	
	LAYERS:
	- nodes with different 'zPosition' properties are layered on top of each other based on that value
	- nodes with the same 'zPosition' are layered in the order in which they appear in the tree, with later nodes rendered on top of the previous ones
	
	GLOBAL Z POSITION:
	- the 'zPosition' value of child nodes is relative to their parents, but an accumulated global value is calculated for all nodes
	- this makes it possible for nodes in different tree branches to still overlap based on this global value
	- (unlike css in web browsers, where an element's z position is scoped within their parents)
	- an exception is child nodes of SKCropNode and SKEffectNode instances, in these cases the child nodes are scoped
	
	RENDERING OPTIMISATIONS:
	the default behaviour of rendering the nodes in array order prevents the system from applying certain performance optimisations,
	you can enable those but that means that the order in which nodes are rendered will be unpredictable, so make sure you avoid causing issues:
	1. make sure you manually give different 'zPosition' values to nodes that can potentially overlap, where you must ensure that one is always on top of the other
	2. give the same 'zPosition' value to nodes that will never overlap, or that can potentially overlap but it's not important which one ends up on top of the other
	3. set the 'ignoresSiblingOrder' property of the SKView element to 'true'
	this will make it so all nodes with the same 'zPosition' will be grouped together and rendered in one pass instead of multiple individual passes
	
	HIT TESTING:
	- nodes are evaluated for hit-testing (user actions detection) in the reverse order as the rendering order (nodes on top are evaluated before elements on the bottom)
	- to handle user interactions, the nodes already implement the UIResponder class, you just need to manually implement its methods
