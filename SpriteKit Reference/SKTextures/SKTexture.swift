	init(cgImage:)					// Loads the texture from an existing Quartz 2D image (CGImage)

	init(data:,size:,rowLength:,alignment:)	// Same, but allows you to limit the number of pixels to display per row, and the spacing between them
	init(data:,size:,flipped:)				// Same, but if 'flipped' is true, the image will be flipped vertically

	// Performance: Data loading
	// ------------------------------
	Creating textures is expensive, especially when loading them from an image file
	because of this, SpriteKit defers the loading of the textures until they actually need to be rendered
	this is a good starting point but you may need to preload and delete the data whenever necessary to improve memory management
	
	A texture is prepared for rendering in 2 steps:
	1. data is loaded (only for textures loaded from an image file, on the other methods the data is already available). This happens when:
		- the size() method is called, including from when a sprite node is being initialized
		- or when one of the preload methods is manually called
	2. data is prepared for rendering. This happens when:
		- A node that uses the texture is about to be rendered
	
	Once a texture is prepared for rendering, it stays in memory until all strong references to it are removed
	
	
	// Performance: Memory management
	// ------------------------------
	Some devices have limited memory, and textures can consume a lot of it, so there's a limit to how many textures you can load at once
	
	Some tips for better memory management:
	- for textures that are essential to a scene that is about to be loaded, preload as many as possible before presenting the scene
	- pre-emptively load the rest of the textures shortly before they are required
	- dispose of textures as soon as you can if you're sure you won't be using it again, this frees up memory
	- if there's a list of images that you generally load at the same time, group them using a SKTextureAtlas ??? to load them in a single pass
	- if multiple nodes use the same texture, make them reference the same texture object instead of creating multiple instances
	
	To remove existing textures from memory, delete all strong references to the texture object, including:
	- all texture references from nodes (sprite, emmiters, etc)
	- all references you have created in your own code
	- all texture atlas objects that includes it
